## Formatting, etc
For writing text, **Please utilise semantic line breaks!**
We utilise tags to categorise issues and PRs to the respective paper.

## Becoming an Author
If you want to become an author of the project open a PR that adds the relevant information

## Publication
We currently have split the topic of teaching RSEs in Germany across four papers.
We aim for a publication of most of these papers.
All people that have participated in discussions with us,
e.g. at deRSE23 or undeRSE23 are at least eligible for contributor status.
If you have participated regularly at our weekly working meetings(try to reach out to fgoth@physik.uni-wuerzburg.de) you are eligible for
authorship.
